        <p class="important">Disconnected is a game about war, but it's not a war game. It aims to make its audience think about consequences of conflicts that are usually not seen and considered not important. Disconnected asks the users to live a day in the life of a mother who lost her son. The more they engage with her, the more they can discover about her and her family through emerging memories.</p>

        <p class="important">02.08.1980 was a proposal for a VR project created for the Performance Theory and Analysis course. On the second of August 1980, a terrorist attack destroyed the central station of my city, Bologna. Part of "the strategy of terror", the aim of the attack was to strike fear in the population. However, the city reacted and united. The proposal was designed to allow the city to celebrate the anniversary of the attack in times of lockdown (when the usual celebration around Bologna was not possible), with various interactive and collaborative experiences in VR.</p>

        <p class="important">For the Digital Art and Performance course, my team and I created a cultural jamming exhibition on misinformation and data-veillance, which consisted of a video and a small game. We created a fake corporation that pretended to teach people how to recognise fake news, while actually trying to promote a biased point of view while taking their data. At the end, the users received a summary of all the information that the company managed to extract from them, as well as which biases it managed to exploit to make them believe what it wanted them to believe.</p>
