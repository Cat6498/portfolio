            <p class="important text-center" >For the third year software development project at University, my team was assigned to a client with an idea for a mobile app for suicide prevention. At the end of the course, we decided to keep working together as a team, and we are currently developing an app for overdose prevention.

        <p class="important">Our client wanted a proof of concept, so during university we kept a very simple design due to time constraints. In the team, I was the product owner and front-end developer, but I ended up learning and working on back-end development, code reviews and coding sessions, testing and test driven development, CI/CD, issues and iterations, and demonstrations in customer's days.</p>

        <p class="important">When the project was over, we decided to keep working as a team, and to use what we learnt to make a similar app, but for overdose prevention. As first thing, I went back to sketching and prototyping. After talking with lecturers about creating a start-up however, we decided to suspend the project to focus on our final year at University.</p>

        <p class="important">Now that University is over, we are working on the app again. With an extra year of experience (and a new version of Flutter), we are set on creating a high-quality app that we hope could have a positive impact on society. Right now, I'm focused on creating an easy to use and intuitive interface, with a minimalist and modern UI.</p>
