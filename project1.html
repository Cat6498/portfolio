            <p class="important text-center" >There are several AI painters that can turn an image into a painting in a pixel-wise fashion. For my dissertation project, my supervisor asked me: could we make an AI agent paint "more humanly"? He wanted the agent to be able to paint stroke by stroke, and to pay attention to the objects in the scene in some way.

        <p class="important">Knowing basically nothing about AI and computer vision, I spent the first two months researching and experimenting with existing approaches (you can see a section of my research map here). I learnt a lot, and identified the points that I wanted to carry over to my project as well as the ones that I wanted to improve. I selected a couple of baselines, and created a backbone for an agent that could paint stroke by stroke using generative adversarial networks.</p>

        <h1 class="subtit">Making the painter</h1>
        <p class="important">On suggestion of my supervisor, I researched saliency prediction, which led me to object segmentation and recognition. I came up with a strategy to decide the importance of objects in a scene by combining panoptic segentation and saliency maps. Then, I found a way for the backbone of the painter to use this information to distribute the strokes on the canvas while painting. Since I had two variations of both strategies, I had 4 different painting methods.</p>

        <h1 class="subtit">Evaluation and improvements</h1>
        <p class="important">I kept optimising and improving the painters, and I implemented two ways to perform neural style transfer. Finally, I evaluated the painters both quantitatively and qualitatively, from which I found that they preserved the structural integrity of the objects in the paintings better than the baselines, and were overall preferred by the evaluators.</p>
