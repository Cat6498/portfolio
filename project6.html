        <h1 class="subtit">Setting up</h1>
        <p class="important">The first step was setting up the installations, which took us a couple of days. One of them, Lux AEterna allowed the participants to create music by touching a circle of light projected in the centre of the room. It also featured a smoke tunnel to make the light visible and to provide a beautiful visual effect.</p>

        <p class="important">When the festival opened, I was assigned to Lux AEterna as invigilator. I would set up the installation in the morning, welcome and guide the audience and answer their questions, and turn everything off in the evening. I would also check that everything was working properly, and spray the smoke in the room with the fog machine.</p>

        <h1 class="subtit">Getting the audience involved</h1>
        <p class="important">The initial idea was that I would just stand in the room, and answer the audience's questions if they had any. However, I soon realised that, in this way, they would look at the circle of light, but they wouldn't try to interact with it. I started trying some things to involve them, like placing footsteps made of tape in the interactive space, and giving a demo when spectators entered the room. After a while, I found a strategy that worked pretty well, and I managed to gather a lot more positive feedback forms than the other installations in the same location.</p>
